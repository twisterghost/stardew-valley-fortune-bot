# Stardew Valley Fortune Bot

This is a tiny lil' twitter bot that chooses a "fortune" from the pre-canned fortune teller dialogues in Stardew Valley. Each morning at 6am NY time, it tweets out the day's fortune.

You can see it live at [@StardewFortune](https://twitter.com/stardewfortune)

## Installation & Setup

```shell
$ git clone ...
$ cd stardew-valley-fortune-bot
$ npm i
```

The bot will need four environment variables to run:

```
BOT_CONSUMER_KEY
BOT_CONSUMER_SECRET
BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN
BOT_ACCESS_SECRET
```

These tokens correspond to the twitter API keys available in the app info on [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com)
